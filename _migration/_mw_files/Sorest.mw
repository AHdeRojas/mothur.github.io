The [[sorest]] calculator returns an estimate of the traditional [[sorclass | Sorenson]] index using Chao1 richness estimates for the richness of [[chao | individual]] samples and the richness of the [[sharedchao | shared]] OTUs. This calculator can be used in the [[summary.shared]] and [[collect.shared]] commands.


<math>D_{Sorenson} = 1-\frac{2S_{AB, Chao}}{S_{A,Chao} + S_{B,Chao}}</math>


where,

<math>S_{AB,Chao}</math> = estimated number of OTUs shared between A and B using the [[sharedchao]] calculator.

<math>S_{A,Chao}</math> = number of OTUs estimated in A using the [[chao]] calculator.

<math>S_{B,Chao}</math> = number of OTUs estimated in B using the [[chao]] calculator.



Open the file 98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.sabund generated using the [[Media:AmazonData.zip | Amazonian dataset]] with the following commands:

 mothur > cluster(phylip=98_lt_phylip_amazon.dist, cutoff=0.10)
 mothur > make.shared(list=98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.list, group=amazon.groups, label=0.10)



The 98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.[[shared file]] will contain the following two lines:

 0.10	forest	55	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	2	2	1	1	3	2	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	2	5	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	
 0.10	pasture	55	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	1	1	1	1	1	7	1	1	2	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	


This indicates that the label for the OTU definition was 0.10.  The first line is from the forest  sample and the second is from the pasture sample.  There are a total of 55 OTUs between the two communities.  Elsewhere, we used the [[sharedchao]] calculator to estimate that the shared richness was 30.5 OTUs.  The following commands using the [[chao]] calculator will provide the single sample Chao1 richness estimates:

 mothur > summary.single(shared=98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.shared, calc=chao)

The output of these commands indicates Chao1 richness estimates of 78 ((95% CI=48 to 164) and 69.1 (95% CI=46 to 136) for the pasture and forest samples, respectively.  Basically, we would predict that all of the forest OTUs are shared.


<math>D_{Sorenson}= 1-\frac{2\left(30.5\right)}{78+69.1}=0.585437</math>



Running...
 mothur > summary.shared(shared=98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.shared, calc=sorest)



...and opening 98_lt_phylip_amazon.fn.shared.summary gives:

 label	comparison		SorEst
 0.10	forest	pasture		0.585437

These are the same values that we found above for a cutoff of 0.10.
