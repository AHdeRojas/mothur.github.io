Welcome to the website for the **mothur** project,
initiated by [Dr. Patrick Schloss](https://www.mothur.org) and his
software development team in the
[Department of Microbiology &
Immunology](https://www.med.umich.edu/microbio/) at [The University of
Michigan](https://www.umich.edu). This project seeks to develop a single
piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the bioinformatics
needs of the microbial ecology community. We have incorporated the
functionality of dotur, sons, treeclimber, s-libshuff, unifrac, and much
more. In addition to improving the flexibility of these algorithms, we
have added a number of other features including calculators and
visualization tools. If you would like to contribute code to the project
feel free to download the source code and make your own improvements.
Alternatively, if you have an idea or a need, but lack the programming
expertise, let us know and we\'ll add it to the queue of features we
would like to add. Our current goal is to release a new iteration of the
project monthly.
