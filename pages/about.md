This is the website that supports the mothur software program - one of the most widely used tools for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequence data. Step inside to learn how to use the software, get help, and join our community!

If you're looking for papers from the Schloss lab that form the basis of mothur's functions, the default values, and our approach, see [this listing](http://www.schlosslab.org/science/bioinformatic_tools) from the lab's website. Perhaps the most important papers are those that announced mothur and the 2020 retrospective on mothur's development.
