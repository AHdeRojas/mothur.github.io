$$D_{Memchord} = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{S_T}  \left ( \frac{S_{Aj}}{\sqrt{S_A}} - \frac{S_{Bj}}{\sqrt {S_B}} \right )^2  }$$

-   where $$S_{T}$$ is the total number of OTUs
-   where $$S_{Aj}$$ is 1 if the abundance of the jth OTU in sample a is
    greater than zero, otherwise 0.
-   where $$S_{Bj}$$ is 1 if the abundance of the jth OTU in sample b is
    greater than zero, otherwise 0.
-   where $$S_{a}$$ is the number of nonzero OTUs in sample a.
-   where $$S_{b}$$ is the number of nonzero OTUs in sample b.
