title: 'Column-formatted distance matrix'
---
Most of the currently used software packages store all of the pairwise
distances in RAM before printing them out to disk. This can suck up a
considerable amount of RAM to the point that it is prohibitive for
analyzing the size of data sets generated by pyrosequencing. An
alternative format, used by mothur, is to represent the matrix as a
three column table. The first and second columns have the sequence names
and the third column is the distance between those sequences. An example
of this is provided in 96\_sq\_column\_amazon.dist, which can be
obtained from the [ AmazonData.zip](https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wiki/amazondata.zip) zip
file:

    U68589 U68589  0.0000
    U68589 U68590  0.3371
    U68589 U68591  0.3609
    U68589 U68592  0.4155
    U68589 U68593  0.2872
    U68589 U68594  0.2970
    U68589 U68595  0.3922
    U68589 U68596  0.3093
    ...

This file contains all 9216 (96x96) unique pairwise distances. Note that
this file is actually bigger than the 98\_sq\_phylip\_amazon.dist file.
mothur can also take in a lower or upper triangle matrix representation
in column format as shown in 96\_lt\_column\_amazon.dist, which has
4,560 rows:

    U68590 U68589  0.337144
    U68591 U68589  0.360977
    U68591 U68590  0.378254
    U68592 U68589  0.415506
    U68592 U68590  0.319757
    U68592 U68591  0.414843
    U68593 U68589  0.287299
    U68593 U68590  0.169021
    ...

This file is similar in size to 96\_lt\_phylip\_amazon.dist. You\'ll
note that the file does not have any rows where U68589 is in the first
column. Because of this, it is mandatory that a name file be used with
the read.column() command.
