The name file is used to show the relationship between a representative
sequence and the sequences it represents. It consists of 2 columns
separated by a tab. The first column contains the representative
sequence\'s name. The second column contains the names of its
representatives separated by commas. Here is an example:

    65_6_19    65_6_19
    65_10_4    65_10_4
    65_10_10   65_10_10,65_10_8,65_4_21,65_6_16,65_7_17,65_7_6,65_9_14
    65_5_11    65_5_11
    65_8_3 65_8_3
    65_1_2 65_1_2,65_1_23,65_2_1,65_2_8
    65_3_5 65_3_5
    65_2_21    65_2_21,65_3_12,65_3_3,65_3_6
    ...

Notes:


1\.  Be sure not to include the \"\>\" in the name of the sequence.
