title: 'Alignment database'
---
To make use of the aligner in mothur, you need a reference database.
Here we provide 16S rRNA sequence alignments. If you have a reference
alignment that you would like to donate, please add it to the list.

## rRNA gene sequences

### greengenes

The greengenes alignment is 7,682 columns long and is basically the
alignment that ARB started with. The variable regions could use some
improving, but few people get paid enough to do it all themselves. You
can download copies of the [greengenes-formatted
databases](greengenes-formatted_databases).

### SILVA

You can download copies of our attempt to recreate the [ SILVA SEED
databases](Silva_reference_files) for the Bacteria, Archaea,
and Eukarya
