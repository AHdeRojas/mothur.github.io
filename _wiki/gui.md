## Issues

-   Pipeline window doesn\'t scale well when you shrink the window
-   Possible to select on a command and move it up and down the list

<!-- -->

-   Close button doesn\'t seem to do anything - close button closes a
    pipeline.

## Done

-   Possible to make entry to the GUI \"prettier\" - more like an
    application?
-   Preferences - allow user to pick constant reference files,
    processors, etc
-   Can we get rid of path names in the pipeline folder (and file
    names)?
-   Need a folder in the Analysis window that has a list of all of the
    commands
-   Put a red dot next to windows that are required (remove red dot when
    filled)
-   Organize options to put important windows/options to the top
-   Need to make it smarter
    -   fill in the file names if it\'s given in the first command it
        populates everything else?
    -   refresh option to repopulate the names starting at the selected
        command
