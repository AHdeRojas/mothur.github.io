## Mac executable

We have compiled clearcut on Mac OS X 10.5, but it has also been tested
for 10.6. Please let us know how this works for you: [ clearcut for
mac](https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wiki/clearcut.mac.zip)

## Windows executable

We have compiled clearcut for Windows. We're pretty sure that the same
executable should work for XP and Vista. Please let us know how this
works for you: [ clearcut for
windows](https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wiki/clearcut.win.zip)

## Source code

If you are a linux user or you want to build your own executable
download the [ clearcut source
code](https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wiki/clearcut.source.zip) and follow the instruction
in the README file.
