$$D_{Gower} = \sum_{j=1}^{S_T} \frac {|S_{Aj} - S_{Bj} |} {(\max S_{ij} - \min S_{ij})}$$

-   where $$S_{Aj}$$ is the abundance of sample A in the jth OTU.
-   where $$S_{Bj}$$ is the abundance of sample B in the jth OTU.
-   where $$\max S_{ij}$$ is the maximum abundance in the jth OTU over all
    samples.
-   where $$\min S_A{ij}$$ is the minimum abundance in the jth OTU over
    all samples.
