[Hypothesis testing
approaches](Hypothesis_testing_approaches) allow you to
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the
structuring of your data are more extreme than you would expect by
chance. They cannot indicate a level of similarity - for those types of
questions, you are best served by [OTU-based
approaches](OTU-based_approaches). Examples of each command
are provided within their specific pages, but several users have
provided several [analysis examples](analysis_examples),
which use these commands. An exhaustive list of the commands found in
mothur is available within the [ commands category
index](Special:Categories).

## General commands

-   [dist.seqs](dist.seqs) - generate a distance matrix
-   [deunique.tree](deunique.tree) - reinserts redundant
    sequence identifiers into a unique tree
-   [clearcut](clearcut)

## Analyses

-   [parsimony](parsimony) - the parsimony test, which was
    previously available through
    [TreeClimber](http://schloss.micro.umass.edu/software/treeclimber.html)
-   [unifrac.unweighted](unifrac.unweighted) - the unweighted
    Unifrac algorithm
-   [unifrac.weighted](unifrac.weighted) - the weighted
    Unifrac algorithm
-   [libshuff](libshuff) - the integral and discrete forms of
    the libshuff method
-   [amova](amova)
-   [homova](homova)
-   [mantel](mantel)
-   [anosim](anosim)
-   [cooccurrence](cooccurrence)
