The **deunique.tree** command reinserts the
redundant sequence identiers back into a unique tree. For this tutorial,
you should use the files found in the [
TreeTest.zip](https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wiki/treetest.zip) archive.

To run the command the names of a tree-file and name-file need to be
provided:

    mothur > deunique.tree(tree=test.tre, name=test.names)

This will generate a new tree file containing all the sequences:
test.deunique.tre.
