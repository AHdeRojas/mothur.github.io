R for microbial ecologists. If you are interested in attending and would
like to register or get more information about fees and specifics,
please email him his gmail account (userid: pdschloss)

## mothur workshop

This workshop is geared towards people with diverse backgrounds so you
shouldn\'t feel like this isn\'t for you if you are a beginner. I assume
no previous computer programming experience. The workshop is an even
blend of lecture/discussion and hands on use of mothur with real
sequence data. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop schedule
will look like (although it is subject to some minor changes)\...

*\' Day 1:*\'

-   Overview of methods used in microbial ecology
-   DNA sequencing technologies (Sanger, 454, Illumina, IonTorrent,
    PacBio)
-   Introduction to mothur, command line interface, and GUI
-   Improving sequence quality
-   Alignment

**Day 2:**

-   Chimera detection
-   Distance calaculations
-   Amplicon sequence variants
-   OTU identification
-   Sequence/OTU classification

**Day 3:**

-   Intro to microbial ecology
-   Methods of measuring alpha and beta diversity
-   Population level analyses

## R Workshop

This workshop is being filled on a first come, first served basis. The
workshop is geared towards people with interests in microbial ecology
that would like to learn R or to learn it better so you shouldn\'t feel
like this isn\'t for you if you are a beginner. I assume no previous
computer programming experience. The workshop is an even blend of
lecture/discussion and hands on use of R with real data and typically
uses mothur output files as a starting point. It is taught around the
generation of data visualization methods commonly used by microbial
ecologists. Along the way we\'ll learn a number of ways to work with
data from within R. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop
schedule will look like (it is subject to some minor changes)\...

-   Ordination
-   Stripcharts and box and whisker plots
-   Line plots
-   Barcharts
-   Subsetting data
-   Reading and writing data
-   Basic parametric and non-parametric analyses

The workshop will give you a pretty thorough set of working examples for
how to use packages like readr, dplyr, and ggplot2 with data from
mothur; however, prior knowledge of mothur is not a prerequisite.
