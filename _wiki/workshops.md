Throughout 2020, Pat will offer **workshops** on mothur and programming in R
for microbial ecologists. These will be offered online. If you are
interested in attending and would like to register or get more
information about fees and specifics, please email him his gmail account
(userid: pdschloss). Other workshops will be announced throughout the
year.

- June 21-24: mothur workshop (10 PM-3 AM EDT (GMT-400))
- July 15-17: Microbial Ecology R workshop (9 AM-4 PM EDT (GMT-400))
- August 12-14: mothur workshop (9 AM-4 PM EDT (GMT-400))


## General R Workshop

This workshop is being filled on a first come, first served basis. The
workshop is geared towards people who would like to learn R or to learn
it better using a diverse collection of datasets. This workshop is
intended for beginners and more advanced R programmers who would like
to fill their gaps in knowledge. I assume no previous computer
programming experience. The workshop is an even blend of
lecture/discussion and hands on use of R with real data. The material is
centered on learning how to solve problems using functions from the
"tidyverse". The workshop will give you a pretty thorough set of working
examples for how to use packages like ggplot2, readr, dplyr, stringr, and
lubridate. More importantly, the workshop will emphasize developing
problem solving skills for solving data and programming problems. The
materials can be found on the [Riffomonas website](http://www.riffomonas.org/generalR/)



## mothur workshop

This workshop is geared towards people with diverse backgrounds so you
shouldn't feel like this isn't for you if you are a beginner. I assume
no previous computer programming experience. The workshop is an even
blend of lecture/discussion and hands on use of mothur with real
sequence data. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop schedule
will look like (although it is subject to some minor changes)\...

**Day 1:**

-   Overview of methods used in microbial ecology
-   DNA sequencing technologies (Sanger, 454, Illumina, IonTorrent,
    PacBio)
-   Introduction to mothur, command line interface, and GUI
-   Improving sequence quality
-   Alignment

**Day 2:**

-   Chimera detection
-   Distance calaculations
-   Amplicon sequence variants
-   OTU identification
-   Sequence/OTU classification

**Day 3:**

-   Intro to microbial ecology
-   Methods of measuring alpha and beta diversity
-   Population level analyses

The workshop is an expanded discussion on the [MiSeq SOP](wiki/MiSeq_SOP).


## Microbial Ecology R Workshop

This workshop is being filled on a first come, first served basis. The
workshop is geared towards people with interests in microbial ecology
that would like to learn R or to learn it better so you shouldn't feel
like this isn't for you if you are a beginner. I assume no previous
computer programming experience. The workshop is an even blend of
lecture/discussion and hands on use of R with real data and typically
uses mothur output files as a starting point. It is taught around the
generation of data visualization methods commonly used by microbial
ecologists. Along the way we'll learn a number of ways to work with
data from within R. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop
schedule will look like (it is subject to some minor changes)\...

-   Ordination
-   Stripcharts and box and whisker plots
-   Line plots
-   Barcharts
-   Subsetting data
-   Reading and writing data
-   Basic parametric and non-parametric analyses

The workshop will give you a pretty thorough set of working examples for
how to use packages like readr, dplyr, and ggplot2 with data from
mothur; however, prior knowledge of mothur is not a prerequisite. The
materials we will follow are available on the [Riffomonas website](http://www.riffomonas.org/minimalR/)
