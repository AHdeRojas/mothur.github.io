$$D_{Canberra} = \frac {1}{S_{T}}   \sum_{j=1}^{S_T} \frac {|S_{Aj} - S_{Bj}|} {S_{Aj} + S_{Bj} }$$

-   $$S_{Aj}$$ is the abundance of the jth OTU in sample A
-   $$S_{Bj}$$ is the abundance of the jth OTU in sample B
-   $$S_{T}$$ is the number of OTU\'s combined between sample A and sample
    B
