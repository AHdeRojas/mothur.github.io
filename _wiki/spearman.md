$$D_{Spearman} = 1 - \frac{6 \sum_{j=1}^{S_T}  \left ( rank(S_{Aj}) - rank(S_{Bj}) \right )^2} {S_T (S^2_T-1)}$$

-   where $$rank(S_{Aj})$$ is the number of OTUs in sample A with higher
    or equal abundance to $$S_{Aj}$$.
-   where $$rank(S_{Bj})$$ is the number of OTUs in sample B with higher
    or equal abundance to $$S_{Bj}$$.
-   where S\_T is the total number of OTUs.
