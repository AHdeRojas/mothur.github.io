$$D_{Structchi2} = \sqrt{N_T \sum_{j=1}^{S_T} \left ( \frac {1}{S_{+j}} \left ( \frac{S_{Aj}}{S_{A+}} - \frac{S_{Bj}}{S_{B+}} \right )^2 \right ) }$$

-   where $$N_T$$ is the total number of sequences
-   where $$S_{A+}$$ denotes the total abundance of sample A
-   where $$S_{B+}$$ denotes the total abundance of sample B
-   where $$S_{Aj}$$ is the abundance of sample A in the jth OTU.
-   where $$S_{Bj}$$ is the abundance of sample B in the jth OTU.
-   where $$S_{+j}$$ denotes the total abundance of OTU j.
