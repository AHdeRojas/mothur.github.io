[Hypothesis testing
approaches](/wiki/Hypothesis_testing_approaches) allow you to
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the
structuring of your data are more extreme than you would expect by
chance. They cannot indicate a level of similarity - for those types of
questions, you are best served by [OTU-based
approaches](/wiki/OTU-based_approaches). Examples of each command
are provided within their specific pages, but several users have
provided several [analysis examples](/wiki/analysis_examples),
which use these commands. An exhaustive list of the commands found in
mothur is available within the [ commands category
index](/wiki/tags#commands).

## General commands

-   [dist.seqs](/wiki/dist.seqs) - generate a distance matrix
-   [deunique.tree](/wiki/deunique.tree) - reinserts redundant
    sequence identifiers into a unique tree
-   [clearcut](/wiki/clearcut)

## Analyses

-   [parsimony](/wiki/parsimony) - the parsimony test, which was
    previously available through
    [treeclimber](https://github.com/mothur/TreeClimber)
-   [unifrac.unweighted](/wiki/unifrac.unweighted) - the unweighted
    Unifrac algorithm
-   [unifrac.weighted](/wiki/unifrac.weighted) - the weighted
    Unifrac algorithm
-   [libshuff](/wiki/libshuff) - the integral and discrete forms of
    the libshuff method
-   [amova](/wiki/amova)
-   [homova](/wiki/homova)
-   [mantel](/wiki/mantel)
-   [anosim](/wiki/anosim)
-   [cooccurrence](/wiki/cooccurrence)
