Let x be the relative abundances of one sample and y be the relative abundances of the other and m be the average relative abundances of the 2 samples.

 JSD(x,y)= sqrt(1/2 KLD(x,m)+ 1/2 KLD(y,m))

where KLD is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between x and y defined by:

 KLD(x,y)=âˆ‘ xi log xi / yi
