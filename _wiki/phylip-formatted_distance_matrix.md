Phylip [1](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) is a
widely popular collection of programs developed by Joseph Felsenstein at
the University of Washington and includes a tool called dnadist
[2](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/dnadist.html).
This is a pretty standard format for representing a distance matrix and
can be generated by MEGA, ARB, and pretty much every piece of software
out there. The basic format of a phylip-formatted distance matrix is to
have the number of sequences described by the distance matrix on the
first row. Successive lines have the sequence name as well as the
pairwise distance from that sequence to the other sequences. These
matrices come in two flavors - a square matrix and a lower-triangular
matrix.

## Square matrices

In the square matrix format each sequence listed in the distance matrix
has all of the pairwise distances between it and every other distance in
the sequence collection. If you were to look at the matrix, it would
look like a square and the values along the diagonal from the top-left
corner to the bottom-right corner would be zeros and that the triangles
mirror each other.

The file 98\_sq\_phylip\_amazon.dist is an example of a square matrix,
which can be obtained from the [

## Lower-triangle matrices

Alternatively, to save some hard drive memory, a lower-triangle
representation is possible. In this case the first line again has the
number of sequences in the matrix. The difference is that each
subsequent line has the distance between the sequence represented by the
line and every sequence up to that sequence. So when you look at the
matrix in a text editor, you\'ll notice that it contains the distances
below the diagonal of zeros that you would have in a square matrix.

The file 98\_lt\_phylip\_amazon.dist is an example of a square matrix:

    98
    U68589
    U68590 0.3371
    U68591 0.3609  0.3782
    U68592 0.4155  0.3197  0.4148
    U68593 0.2872  0.1690  0.3361  0.2842
    U68594 0.2970  0.3293  0.3563  0.3325  0.2768

ARB exclusively generates lower triangular matrices. Although we are
unaware of any software that produce upper triangle matrices, such a
matrix would be the mirror of a lower triangle matrix. All of this
discussion is somewhat unnecessary because as long as mothur knows that
you are providing a phylip-formatted matrix, it can identify the shape
of the matrix.
