Once one has a general grasp of several important concepts, they should
find mothur to be a very powerful and fast program for facilitating
their research objectives. Please keep in mind that mothur is not a
polished commercial piece of software, just as your mothur may have one
or two flaws, so does ours. Unlike your mothur, we won't disown you if
you bring them up. Please let us know what could be done to improve the
usability of the program and any bugs you encounter.
