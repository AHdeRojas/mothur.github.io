## Package Options

Mothur allows for several survey related environmental package choices.
They include: air, host\_associated, human\_associated, human\_gut,
human\_oral, human\_skin, human\_vaginal, microbial, miscellaneous,
plant\_associated, sediment, soil, wastewater or water.
Default=miscellaneous. Unknown or inapplicable fields can be filled in
with \'missing\'.
