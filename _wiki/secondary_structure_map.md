We transcribed the secondary structure mapping using the arb-compatible
SILVA and greengenes databases. The files contain one column. Each row
in the column indicates the row that row maps to. If there is a 0 in the
row, then that position is in a loop. There needs to be an equal number
of rows and bases in the alignment. For example, the SILVA secondary
structure map file contains 50,000 rows. You are free to construct your
own secondary structure mapping files.
