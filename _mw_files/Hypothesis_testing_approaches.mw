[[Hypothesis testing approaches]] allow you to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the structuring of your data are more extreme than you would expect by chance.  They cannot indicate a level of similarity - for those types of questions, you are best served by [[OTU-based approaches]].  Examples of each command are provided within their specific pages, but several users have provided several [[analysis examples]], which use these commands.  An exhaustive list of the commands found in mothur is available within the [[Special:Categories | commands category index]].
