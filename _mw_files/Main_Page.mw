Welcome to the website for the [[Main_Page | mothur]] project, initiated by [http://www.mothur.org Dr. Patrick Schloss] and his [[software development team]] in the [http://www.med.umich.edu/microbio/ Department of Microbiology & Immunology] at [http://www.umich.edu The University of Michigan].  This project seeks to develop a single piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology community.  We have incorporated the functionality of dotur, sons, treeclimber, s-libshuff, unifrac, and much more.  In addition to improving the flexibility of these algorithms, we have added a number of other features including calculators and  visualization tools.  If you would like to contribute code to the project feel free to download the source code and make your own improvements.  Alternatively, if you have an idea or a need, but lack the programming expertise, let us know and we'll add it to the queue of features we would like to add.  Our current goal is to release a new iteration of the project monthly.

* '''[https://groups.io/g/mothur/join Join the mothur mailing list]''' - Receive updates about new mothur releases and upcoming workshops

* '''Peruse the [[mothur manual]]''' - Feel free to take a look around at what mothur can do for you.  Don't worry, it won't tell you to wash behind your ears.  Once you've registered, feel free to add or edit content in the manual.

* '''Interested in helping with the [[software development | development]] of the mothur project?''' - Take a look at the steps you need to follow to develop a command that can be integrated into mothur.

* '''Keep up to date on future [[workshops]]''' - Dr. Schloss offers several workshops a year near Detroit, Michigan

* '''[[Collaboration]]''' - Are you pulling together a grant proposal and don't think you can sell your abilities to do computational microbial ecology?  Do you have a chunk of data that you don't know  what to do with?  We are happy to put together subcontract quotes to meet your needs.
