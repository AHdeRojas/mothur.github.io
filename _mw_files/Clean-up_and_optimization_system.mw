Nowadays Mackeeper is recognized as a software for complex maintenance of Mac OS X-based computers. It's a third-party Mac OS X system tool, which has been initially released in 2010 and after its launching it overcame a few upgrades, which engaged some broadening of internal tools. All of them can be ultimately split into four classes: anti-virus security and real-time safeguard, Mac files command, clean-up and optimization system. Every class incorporates a few separate instruments that work independently from each other, but they all remain put together in one graphical user interface. The current release of Mackeeper delivers enhanced capabilities in physical security of MacBooks as a result of improved anti-robbery function, which is included into "security" branch.
