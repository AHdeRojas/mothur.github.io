==Default mode==

When you start mothur, you will see a screen that looks like this:

 Type 'help()' for information on the commands that are available
 
 Type 'quit()' to exit program
 
 mothur >

All of your commands will be entered from the mothur prompt.  You can get a list of commands by typing help() at the prompt and you can get more specific help for each command by typing command_name(help) at the prompt.  For example:

 mothur > align.seqs(help)

Would give you the help file information for the [[align.seqs]] command.


If you want to quit mothur you simply enter:

 mothur > quit()

or

 mothur > quit

With the exception of quit, all commands require you to provide an open and close parentheses.  If you supply any options there cannot be a space between the option, the '=', and the option setting.  To separate options, use a comma.  For example:

 mothur > cluster(method=furthest, cutoff=0.10)

==Environment Variables==
Environment variables can be used to generalize variables for reuse. Let's add environment variables to our analysis.

===Format===
The format of environmental variables is [tag]=[value]. For example, let's create a environment variable for the processors option.

 PROC=12

Mothur will automatically pull in the systems environment variable. For example you can set variables in bash and then run mothur:

 MothurMac-3% export REFERENCE_LOCATION=/Users/sarahwestcott/Desktop/release
 MothurMac-3% export ALIGNREF=silva.v4.fasta
 MothurMac-3% export TAXONREF_FASTA=trainset9_032012.pds.fasta
 MothurMac-3% export TAXONREF_TAX=trainset9_032012.pds.tax
 MothurMac-3% export CONTAMINENTS=Chloroplast-Mitochondria-unknown-Archaea-Eukaryota
 MothurMac-3% export LOGNAME=MiSEQ_SOP_mouse_03032020
 MothurMac-3% export DATA=/Users/sarahwestcott/Desktop/MiSeq_SOP
 MothurMac-3% export TYPE=gz
 MothurMac-3% export PROC=12
 MothurMac-3% ./mothur 
 
 Type 'quit()' to exit program
 
 [NOTE]: Setting random seed to 19760620.
 
 mothur >  set.logfile(name=$LOGNAME)
 
 mothur > set.dir(input=$DATA)
 Mothur's directories:
 inputDir=/Users/sarahwestcott/Desktop/MiSeq_SOP


===Use===
The '$' symbol indicates to mothur that the value is an environment variable to be replaced with the actual value at run time. For example:

 PROC=12
 make.contigs(file=current, processors=$PROC)

is equivalent to 

 make.contigs(file=current, processors=12)

You can create an environment variable for anything you wish as well as combining variables. For example:

 mothur > REFERENCE_LOCATION=/Users/sarahwestcott/Desktop/release
 Setting environment variable REFERENCE_LOCATION to /Users/sarahwestcott/Desktop/release
 
 mothur > ALIGNREF=silva.v4.fasta
 Setting environment variable ALIGNREF to silva.v4.fasta
 
 mothur > align.seqs(fasta=my.fasta, reference=$REFERENCE_LOCATION/$ALIGNREF)


Alternatively, If you know what commands you will be running, you can use either the [[command line mode]] or [[batch mode]].
