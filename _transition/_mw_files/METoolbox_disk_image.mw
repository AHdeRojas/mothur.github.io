Although it is not as professionally developed as ARBuntu available from Ribocon, we are making available a free version of a Dell laptop running Ubuntu running ARB, mothur, and the other software that our laboratory uses.  It comes with example data sets and databases that we use in workshops and throughout this wiki and alignment databases.  This is an iso image that you will need to burn to a DVD or USB stick.  It is ~1 GB in size.  You can use it as a live DVD or to install the operating system.


We would appreciate people's feedback on this resource.

You can download the iso image from the [http://schloss.micro.umass.edu/software/METoolbox.iso Schloss lab website]
