The unweighted complete tree (CT) measure calculates the dissimilarity between a pair of communities by considering the amount of shared, unique, and external branch length within a tree spanning ''all'' sequences from ''all'' communities. It is an unweighted or qualitative measure as only the presence or absence of a sequence is considered. This calculator can be used with the [[phylo.betadiversity]] command. The dissimilarity between communities ''i'' and ''j'' is given by:

<math>D_{CT} = \frac{b+c}{a^*+b+c+d}</math>

where,

<math>a^*</math> = the amount of branch length shared by the two communities within the CL subtree.

<math>b</math> = the amount of branch length unique to community ''i''.

<math>c</math> = the amount of branch length unique to community ''j''.

<math>d</math> = the amount of branch length external to communities ''i'' and ''j''.
