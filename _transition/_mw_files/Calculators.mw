The following are a list of [[calculators]] currently available in mothur for OTU-based analyses.  If there is a calculator that you think should be added, please consider either contributing your code or asking us to add it to our list of features for future versions of mothur.  Following the links will take you to pages describing the formulae and example calculations using the Amazonian dataset.
