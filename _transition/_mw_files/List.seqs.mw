The [[list.seqs]] command will write out the names of the sequences found within a [[fastq file | fastq]], [[fasta file | fasta]], [[name file | name]], [[group file | group]], [[Count_File | count]], [[list file | list]], or [[align.report file | align.report]] file.  This could be useful for using the [[get.seqs]] and [[remove.seqs]] commands as well as to generate a [[group file]].    To complete this analysis, you need to download the folder compressed in the [[Media:Esophagus.zip | Esophagus.zip]] archive.

__NOTOC__

==Options==
At least one of the following options must be used.  Each of these options will generate a file ending in accnos that contains a single column containing the list of the sequences contained in the input file.

===fastq option===

The fastq option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(fastq=test.fastq)

===fasta option===
The fasta option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(fasta=esophagus.fasta)

The resulting esophagus.accnos file looks something like:

 59_10_1
 59_10_10
 59_10_11
 59_10_13
 59_10_15
 59_10_16
 59_10_17
 ...

===name option===
The name option is used as presented in the following command (be sure to run [[unique.seqs]] on esophagus.fasta first):

 mothur > list.seqs(name=esophagus.names)

===count option===
The [[Count_File | count]] file is similar to the name file in that it is used to represent the number of duplicate sequences for a given representative sequence.  It can also contain group information.

 mothur > list.seqs(count=esophagus.count_table)

===group option===
The group option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(group=esophagus.groups)

===alignreport option===
The alignreport option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(alignreport=esophagus.align.report)

===list option===
The list option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(list=esophagus.fn.list)

===taxonomy option===
The taxonomy option is used as presented in the following command:

 mothur > list.seqs(taxonomy=esophagus.silva.full.taxonomy)


==Revisions==
* 1.28.0 Added count option
* 1.33.0 Added fastq option
* 1.40.0 - Allow for () characters in taxonomy definitions. [https://github.com/mothur/mothur/issues/350 #350]
