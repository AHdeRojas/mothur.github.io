==Mac executable==
We have compiled clearcut on Mac OS X 10.5, but it has also been tested for 10.6. Please let us know how this works for you: [[Media:clearcut.mac.zip | clearcut for mac]] 

==Windows executable==
We have compiled clearcut for Windows.  We're pretty sure that the same executable should work for XP and Vista.  Please let us know how this works for you:  [[Media:clearcut.win.zip | clearcut for windows]]

==Source code==
If you are a linux user or you want to build your own executable download the [[Media:clearcut.source.zip | clearcut source code]] and follow the instruction in the README file.
