<math>D_{Canberra} = \frac {1}{S_{T}}   \sum_{j=1}^{S_T} \frac {|S_{Aj} - S_{Bj}|} {S_{Aj} + S_{Bj} } </math>


* <math>S_{Aj}</math> is the abundance of the jth OTU in sample A
* <math>S_{Bj}</math> is the abundance of the jth OTU in sample B
* <math>S_{T}</math> is the number of OTU's combined between sample A and sample B
