If you use the SILVA reference files you should be aware of their [https://www.arb-silva.de/silva-license-information dual-use license].

==Release 138==
The SILVA alignment is 50,000 columns long so that it can be compatible with 18S rRNA sequences as well as archaeal 16S rRNA sequences. In our published opinion, this is the best reference alignment out there - far superior to the greengenes or RDP alignments. It's unclear why this version of the release is smaller than previous releases. We have prepared a [http://blog.mothur.org/2020/03/04/SILVA-v138-reference-files README document] where you can read about the process that we used to generate these references. This is also the first SILVA release that is available under the CC-BY license opening the data up to commercial use
* [[Media:Silva.nr_v138.tgz | Full-length sequences and taxonomy references ]] (129063 bacteria, 2846 archaea, and 14887 eukarya sequences). This reference could be customized for alignments, but could also be used for classification. The uncompressed version is ~6.9 GB and the compressed version is 241 MB.
* [[Media:Silva.seed_v138.tgz | Recreated SEED database ]] (5741 bacteria, 81 archaea, and 1834 eukarya sequences). The actual reference alignment that SILVA uses with their SINA aligner is called the SEED alignment. We don't know what this actually is. We have tried to duplicate it by identifying the unique sequences in the SSURef database that have a 100% quality score to the SEED alignment (field 'align_ident_slv' in the arb database) and that go from the end of the traditional 8f/27f primer to the beginning of the traditional 1492r primer.  We are providing a composite dataset for bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic sequences. The uncompressed version is 366 MB and the compressed version is 13 MB.

==Release 132==
The SILVA alignment is 50,000 columns long so that it can be compatible with 18S rRNA sequences as well as archaeal 16S rRNA sequences. In our published opinion, this is the best reference alignment out there - far superior to the greengenes alignment. In a shift from our previous version of the SILVA references, we are providing the SEED database, the full-length sequences available from the NR SILVA database, and a SILVA aligned version of the gold database that is used for reference-based chimera detection.
