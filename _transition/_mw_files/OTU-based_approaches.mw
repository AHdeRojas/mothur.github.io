[[OTU-based approaches]] enable you to analyze the frequency distribution of sequences found in bins using a variety of methods.  In contrast to [[hypothesis testing approaches]], these methods allow you to quantify ecological features such as richness, diversity, and similarity.  Prior to running any of the below listed commands, you will need to do some [[sequence processing]].  Examples of each command are provided within their specific pages, but several users have provided several [[analysis examples]], which use these commands.  An exhaustive list of the commands found in mothur is available within the [[Special:Categories | commands category index]].  Also list of mothur's [[calculators]] with detailed examples.
